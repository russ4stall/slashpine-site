<h1 id="toc_0">PROGRAM STANDARDS 7-23</h1>

<h3 id="toc_1">Preamble</h3>

<p>For purposes of these Program Standards 7-23, a match is defined as a One-to-One mentoring relationship between a youth and an older mentor, through which the matched parties spend consistent, significant time together, and which is monitored and supported by Professional Program Affiliate Staff (as defined in Standard 6B-03).</p>

<p>A match may be carried out in different settings, which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Community-Based (“CB”), where matches meet in the community;</li>
<li>Site-Based (“SB”), where matches only meet at a designated site (e.g., school, workplace, or other site);</li>
<li>Site-Based Facilitated (“SBF”), where matches only meet at a designated site (e.g., school, workplace or other site) and a staff member is present at all sessions and observing match interactions; and</li>
<li>Site-Based Plus (“SB+”), a hybrid where matches meet both in CB and SB settings. Any match that will be permitted to meet outside of a designated site must follow the volunteer and youth/family enrollment, training, matching and match support procedures of a CB match, even if the primary meeting location will be the designated site.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_2">Standard 7 Innovation</h3>

<p>BBBSA values learning and innovation. Innovation, with careful consideration of associated risks, is critical to deepening the outcomes we seek for children. To allow our work to evolve, and to ensure we are striving to improve, it is important to provide a balance of structure and freedom for Agency innovation.</p>

<p>Agencies that propose to innovate outside of the Program Standards may be permitted to enter into a pilot program with BBBSA. Pilot programs must be developed so that specific data can be collected to evaluate innovative approaches and to ensure positive outcomes for children as well as child safety. A Standards Committee of the Nationwide Leadership Council will review each pilot program request for possible approval and will evaluate the data from approved pilot programs.</p>

<p>In a pilot program, temporary relief from one or more standards may be given to an Agency pursuant to the following approval process:</p>

<div class="bordered-list">
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Research &amp; Design</li>
<li>Phase 2: Application and Approval Process</li>
<li>Phase 3: Conduct Pilot</li>
<li>Phase 4: Report Outcomes</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="toc_3">Standard 8 Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>Quality Assurance reviews will be a thorough review of all program functions, including, but not limited to, Enrollment and Match Support and should review the work of all Program Staff. Staff must receive feedback on the quality of their work. The Agency must have procedures for addressing Agency Staff work that does not meet quality standards.  </p>

<p>The Volunteer Big enrollment process is a comprehensive process to determine eligibility, suitability and matchability of the Volunteer Big applicant. The process gathers the necessary information needed to enable the Agency Staff to prepare recommendations for matching based upon the Volunteer Big applicant’s ability to help meet the needs of a child and form a committed relationship with the child, and to work with the parent/guardian (except in School / Site-based programs), and the Agency.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">Standard 18 Pre-Matching and Matching Process</h3>

<ol>
<li>Agency Staff will assess all information gathered through inquiry and enrollment, applications, references, and interviews of all parties, including taking into consideration parental, Volunteer Big and child preferences, in order to make a thoughtful match selection, with a documented match selection rationale.</li>
<li>The Pre-Match Presentation must be interactive, done in-person or by phone, and must ensure that each party understands the Agency’s matching rationale (including the needs of the child, and what the Volunteer Big brings to the match), resulting in all parties approving the match.  Agency staff will act in accordance with the Agency’s policy on confidentiality.  Agency staff will document match selection rational, reaction to parties (denials and acceptances) and all approval dates. For Technology Enhanced Mentoring (TEM) programs, the presentation may be done via email or via the Technology Enhanced Mentoring secure platform.</li>
<li>The Volunteer Big must approve the match before the match introduction meeting for both Community-based and Site-based matches. For TEM programs, the volunteer must be given the opportunity to voice concerns via email or the TEM secure platform in regard to the potential Child being proposed as a match.</li>
<li>The Parent/Guardian must approve the match before the match introduction meeting for Community-based matches.<br></li>
<li>The Match Introduction Meeting must be in-person and conducted by Agency Staff in order to properly introduce all match parties and review critical information that will build the longest, strongest, safest match possible. For TEM programs, the Match Introduction will occur through a structured email prompt delivered by staff that guides the Big and Little to introduce themselves to each other. Staff must also review the first email exchange between Big and Little to ensure that appropriate introductions took place.  Involvement of the parent/guardian is mandatory for Community-Based and Site-Based Plus matches. Written documentation of completed match introductions for all programs must include, at minimum:

<ol class="bordered-list">
<li>A signed match agreement form containing ground rules/program rules that outline roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each match participant; and</li>
<li>A post-match meeting assessment by Agency Staff, reviewing overall reaction by participants to the match meeting and identifying areas for future match support.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_14">Standard 19 The Youth Outcomes Development Plan</h3>

<p>The Youth Outcomes Development Plan (YODP) describes the outcomes desired for the child as a result of the match. Agency staff will develop a YODP at the start of the match.  Staff use the YODP in match support to encourage and coach the match towards desired outcomes.  Staff must review the plan annually with match participants to assess progress made and make any necessary adjustments.</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">Standard 20 Match Support and Match Supervisory Schedule</h3>

<p>The Agency Staff ensures regular, ongoing contact with each match by conducting private, one-to-one, interactive, match support contacts. The intent of Match Support is to monitor, coach, and guide the match in order to promote the development of the match relationship, match longevity, child safety, and positive youth development. </p>

<ol>
<li>All match support contacts must be documented by Agency staff.<br></li>
<li>Match support contacts must regularly assess:

<ol class="bordered-list">
<li>Child Safety</li>
<li>Relationship Development, including activities and communication between the match participants</li>
<li>Youth Development</li>
<li>Agency Engagement</li>
<li>Additional Needs or Concerns </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Match contacts may be in person, over the phone, or via written or electronic means (email/text/social media) provided a contact involves substantive, two-way communication directly with the match parties and an opportunity for the staff and match parties to engage in follow up questions or discussions.

<ol class="bordered-list">
<li>An attempted contact, leaving a message or voice mail, or sending a contact request via electronic means does not count as a contact.</li>
<li>In-person contacts can satisfy two months of contacts within the first year of the match (for both CB and SB matches).</li>
<li>In TEM programs, match support will also include the added safeguard of email review. Agency staff will review at least two email exchanges per month between each match.  Staff documentation must indicate an understanding of the strengths and challenges of each match, as informed by a combination of match support contacts and review of email exchanges.  If full understanding of match dynamics cannot be understood by reviewing two email exchanges per month, staff will review additional email exchanges.  Agencies will also monitor the TEM secure platform to identify potentially inappropriate discussions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Required Contact Schedule:</li>

<h3 id="toc_16">Standard 21 Match Closure</h3>

<p>The match closure process must include, at a minimum:</p>

<ol>
<li>The match support record must show that reasonable attempts were made by Agency Staff to contact the parent/guardian, child, and the Volunteer Big, individually, to thoroughly explore the reasons for closure, safety levels, level of satisfaction, and youth outcomes associated with the match.</li>
<li>When no child safety issues are present and parties are available and agree, every effort will be made and documented to have a facilitated final communication or visit with the Volunteer Big and with the child (preferably in-person) that provides for:

<ol class="bordered-list">
<li>An explanation for the reason(s) for match closure (as appropriate);</li>
<li>An opportunity to reduce any adverse effects from the match closure for the child; and</li>
<li>An assessment of the accomplishments of the match in delivering positive outcomes.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Agency Staff who had oversight of the match must provide a written assessment and recommendations of the appropriateness for rematch and re-engagement of the parent/guardian, child and/or Volunteer Big, either as a Volunteer Big, Little, donor, Board member or other volunteer, based on their successful past service; any need for additional support or training in future match consideration; and to determine further involvement and on-going communication with the Agency.</li>
<li>Written notification of match closure to all parties, including, when necessary, clarification of the risks assumed by match parties in continuing a relationship outside of the Agency’s supervision.<br></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_17">Standard 22 Reassessment for Re-Match</h3>

<p>If any volunteer is re-enrolling as a volunteer Big, Agency staff must take a purposeful, fresh look at the individual requesting to be matched to determine the eligibility and suitability of the volunteer for a safe, effective match.  This process must include a comprehensive review and assessment of the Agency’s prior experience with the Volunteer Big, including, at a minimum, the following components: </p>

<ul>
<li>initial enrollment information (assessment, background check); </li>
<li>experience, motivation, training &amp; support needs; </li>
<li>adherence to BBBS’ safety guidelines; </li>
<li>reasons for previous match/file closures; and </li>
<li>meaningful life changes that have occurred since the volunteer’s initial enrollment (for example: divorce, significant loss, unemployment, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the review and assessment, staff must determine whether additional collateral information is required.   Additionally, based on the timeline below, staff must comply with the following steps from the Volunteer Enrollment Process:</p>
